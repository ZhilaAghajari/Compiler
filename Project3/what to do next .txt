+see mohammad code and new files we need to consider
+see mohamed grammer code and differences with new grammar in proj3 (especially for part "Syntax Tree Augmentation" in page4 ) --> No difference
-do the above for gitproj
	-int error=0 added to grammar.y and it is returned at the yyerror() of this file
+compare gitproj and mohammad
-see what changes we need for proj3.c and proj3.h using both codes we have
